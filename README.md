# Roof Stacks - Case Study

This case study app is for, basically, creating new orders for an imaginary restaurant and handle their status in the app. 

Users can create new orders but there are some rules before they can add:

- A non-empty name must be entered
- A non-empty contact must be entered
- At least one meal must be selected

Other options are arbitrary to fill.

In the **Order Items** section, I was told to create a custom combobox for selecting the meals. I did not use any external packages, I coded that section by myself.

After users add their new order, they can move the order to the next step by just clicking the button below that says **"Move to ..."**

And that's all! You can try it out from this demo link too: [Case Study](http://roofcase.hicaku.com/)
